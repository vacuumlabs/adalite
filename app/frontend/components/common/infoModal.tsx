                    One of the cardano components we use may be missing some of the rewards. For
                    this reason, staking history and CSV exports may be wrong. However, your staking
                    balance is unaffected by this issue and you can freely withdraw your correct

              We successfully updated AdaLite to support Mary hard fork. No action needed by the
              users. This Cardano protocol update introduces multi-assets (tokens) that can be sent
              over the Cardano network. The received and sent tokens will be shown in the
              transaction history. Currently, you can see the list of your tokens (if you have any)
              only in the drop-down menu in the "Send" interface. We will soon reorganize the wallet
              to provide a more convenient way to list multicurrency tokens. We also temporarily
              removed the "Buy/Sell ADA" feature and the Stake Pool Owner support for pledging from

              AdaLite is introducing the concept of wallet accounts. Apart from other benefits, this
              should allow the users to delegate to multiple staking pools from a single wallet.
              When compared to standard banking products, accounts in cryptocurrency wallets work
              similarly as sub-accounts to your main bank account.

              Please note, as of now, the accounts are supported only on AdaLite and you wonâ€™t be
              able to access funds transferred to accounts other than the first account on different
              wallets such as Daedalus and Yoroi. But it is very likely that this concept will be

              them. At the top of the page, you can see your total balance and total rewards balance

              For users that are delegating to a saturated pool, we display a warning and also
              recommend and prefill one of the AdaLite pools with optimal saturation level. Latest
              release also brought some additional information to "Current delegation" tab,
              including Live stake, ROI and Saturation percentage.

            <Article title="Decreased saturation level from 6th December" icon="">
              IOHK decided to increase the K parameter for staking to 500 on December 6th. This will
              result in a decreased saturation level of pools (~62 million ADA). Therefore starting
              this date, all pools that will have more than 62 million ADA delegated to them will
              receive a penalty on rewards.

              You can redelegate at any point between now and the change. Over the following week,
              we will implement new features to inform users about the Live Stake of the pool they
              are delegating to. Also, as the date of the change will be closing, we will be
              displaying warnings to users that are delegating to a pool that could possibly be
              oversaturated.

              We have already set up two new pools ADLT4 and ADLT5 in order to support this change.
              We encourage delegators from ADLT, ADLT2 and ADLT3 pools to slowly migrate to any of
              the new pools. We will create new pools as needed.

              Staking was introduced to Cardano in a recent Shelley update. You can now delegate
              your ADA to a stake pool that will be mining blocks and you will receive rewards for
              it. This can be done on the new Staking screen accessible through the Staking button
              on the upper left side of the AdaLite user interface. Funds that are staked are not
              locked and are free move. All your staking balance (which are all your funds that are
              on the new Shelley addresses) is staked with the pool that you delegate to. If you
              still have some funds on your non-staking balance, please convert them (which will
              create a transaction that transfers funds to one of your new addresses). There is no
              "unstake" functionality implemented yet but you can always re-delegate to a different
              pool or transfer the funds as you want.

              Ledger HW wallet users can now connect their devices through experimental WebUSB
              standard by clicking on the Connect with WebUSB when accessing their wallet. This
              should bring a better user experience but is supported only on a limited number of
              devices. For Windows users, this works best with Chrome and Windows 10. For Mac users,
              this is already the default protocol when clicking on "Access with Ledger" button (but
              if the protocol is not supported by the OS or browser, we automatically fall back to
              the old U2F standard).
